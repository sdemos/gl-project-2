For reference when grading:

The tall tree and the leaf ball for the tall tree are different meshes, each
with different material properties. The lumpy tree behind the house uses the
same material properties as the leaf ball.

The next thing I need to do is make a textured ground and put a texture on the
house so that it isn't as bare.

All of the models were created using blender (which I learned how to use for
this project) and are exported as wavefront object files, which are included
with the sumbission, but not used in the program. The use comes from a python
script that I wrote to convert wavefront object files to c header files with
the arrays expected by the program for each type of object. I might clean this
one up if I have time. 

Most of the code for this project was ripped from lab 6 and modified for my
use.  I ripped out some of the stuff I don't use. I might consolidate more
(like, not have an option for flat shading) if I have time. 

Hopefully I remember to update this with my next submission
